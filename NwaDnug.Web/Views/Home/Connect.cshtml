            User Groups, and professional groups in general, are a great way to network, become
            informed, better yourself, and stay connected to the community at large.</p>
        <h2>
            Networking</h2>
        <p>
            User Groups are one of the best ways to meet new like-minded individuals and make
            new friends. Along with our monthly meetings, we also try to offer less-formal settings
            to allow relationships to be built. Among these events are our monthly post-meeting
            'Nerd Dinners' as well as nights at the ballpark and bowling nights.</p>
        <h2>
            Become Informed</h2>
        <p>
            Curious about that new technology, but don't have the time to learn it? Want to
            learn about that new software package, but don't have the money to sink into trying
            it out? Well worry no more, our monthly meetings are perfect solution for you. We
            have a different guest speaker every month covering a wide range of topics. Along
            with the main presentation, we also have short 'Lightning' presentations geared
            toward providing you with that 'quick win' that you can start using immediately
            to make your life easier.</p>
        <h2>
            Better Yourself</h2>
        <p>
            Not only do User Groups look great on a resumé, but did you know that they can also
            help you get your next job? We have great relationships with local Recruiting Agencies
            which are always looking for informed enthusiastic professionals for local, and
            no so local, positions. User Groups also allow you to meet and interact with employees
            from other companies in the area who may be looking for people as well. Its always
            helpful to know someone on the inside, right? We also offer great opportunities
            for you to grow your skills by helping coordinate community events, helping the
            group grow, or even become a group leader.</p>
        <h2>
            Stay Connected...</h2>
        <p>
            There are many ways to stay connected with your fellow User Group Members. The most
            popular of which is Social Networking. Our members partcipate in many different
            Social Networks, the most popular of which are <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>,
            <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.
